## Description
ThreeJS Wrapper is a lightweight framework for adding 3d objects and animations to your site.

Get started by checking out the [docs](https://github.com/lostways/three-js-wrapper) or the [examples](https://threejswrapper.com).

I used this library to build the [background](https://github.com/lostways/blog/blob/master/src/components/WireframeSphere.astro) for this site.
